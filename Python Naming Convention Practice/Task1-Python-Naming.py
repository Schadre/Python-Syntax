# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to understand and apply Python's naming conventions, 
# particularly for variables and constants.

# Task 1: Code Correction You have been given a piece of code with several variable and 
# constant names that don't follow the Python naming convention. Your task is to correct them:

PI_VALUE = 3.14 # Constant
user_age = 25 # Variable
user_location = "New York" # Variable
MAX_LIMIT = 1000 # Constant

# Constants are written in all uppercase letters and will never change, the value of PI will always be the same.
